## 🚀 What I Do

I work across the stack, with a focus on:

- Web-based apps using React, Vite, and modern JavaScript tooling  
- Desktop applications with Electron and native frameworks  
- Small tools, bots, and utilities that make workflows smoother

I'm also an open-source developer at **Pilewise**, where a small team of two is building an app to organize and manage files more easily.
